A variation of the famous "Brigadeiro" that is made using coconut and that's really delicious

- ‚è≤Ô∏è Prep time: 90 min (cooling time + roolling the balls)
- üç≥ Cook time: 10 min
- üçΩÔ∏è Servings: 27 (approximately)

## Ingredients

- A can of sweetened condensed milk (395g)
- Unsalted butter (30g)
- Table cream (200g)
- Unsweetened Shredded Coconut (80g)
- Cloves (optional)

## Directions

1. Mix the sweetened condensed milk, the butter, the table cream, 30g of coconut and a pinch of salt in a saucepan;
2. On medium-low heat, stir constantly until it thickens.
3. The right point it's when you use the spatula through the mixture and create a 'path' that takes a while to close.
4. Turn off the stove, put the dessert on a plate and cover it with plastic wrap
5. Take it to the refrigerator and let it cool
6. Grease your hands with butter and make small balls with the mixture you just prepared (the size of each ball is on you, I recommend 18g each);
7. Roll the balls in the rest of the shredded coconut, place them into small paper cups, and, traditionally, we stick a clove on the top.
